# Cloud Collaborator

## getting started

Note : Make sure you have 'npm' or 'yarn' installed on your local machine

To test the project on your local machine run :

```console
foo@bar:~$ npm install
```

alternatively

```console
foo@bar:~$ yarn install
```

To spin up the server run :

```console
foo@bar:~$ npm run start
```

This will fire off the 'start' script which will spin a local server on your machine on port 3000

To use the collaborator got to :

http://localhost:3000/public

on your respective browser

Open this up in multiple tabs and start collaborating!!

Happy collaborating!!
